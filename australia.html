        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

        <p>Prehistoric settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia at least 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were made until 1770, when <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> James COOK took possession of the east coast in the name of Great Britain (all of Australia was claimed as British territory in 1829 with the creation of the colony of Western Australia).</p>

        <p>Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the Allied effort in World Wars I and II.</p>

        <p>In recent decades, Australia has become an internationally competitive, advanced market economy due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s and its location in one of the fastest growing regions of the world economy. Long-term concerns include an aging population, pressure on infrastructure, and environmental issues such as floods, droughts, and bushfires.</p>

        <p>Australia is the driest inhabited continent on earth, making it particularly vulnerable to the challenges of climate change. Australia is home to 10<abbr title="Percent">%</abbr> of the world's biodiversity, and a great number of its flora and fauna exist nowhere else in the world.</p>

           <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>The climate in Australia is generally arid to semiarid, which means the continent can be dry while having large amounts of rain. In the south and east of Australia the climate is temperate, but the north of Australia is always tropical.</p>

            <h3>Economic Overview</h3>
            <p>Australia is an open market with minimal restrictions on imports of goods and services. The process of opening up has increased productivity, stimulated growth, and made the economy more flexible and dynamic. Australia plays an active role in the <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr>, <abbr title="Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation">APEC</abbr>, the <abbr title="Group of 20">G20</abbr>, and other trade forums.</p>

            <p>Australiaâ€™s free trade agreement <abbr title="Free Trade Agreement">(FTA)</abbr> with China entered into force in 2015, adding to existing FTAs with the Republic of Korea, Japan, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, and a regional FTA with <abbr title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">ASEAN</abbr> and New Zealand.</p>

            <p>Australia continues to negotiate bilateral agreements with Indonesia, as well as larger agreements with its Pacific neighbors and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and an Asia-wide Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that includes the 10 ASEAN countries and China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and India.</p>
