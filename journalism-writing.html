          <h2>48 hours “destination story”: Tokyo, Japan</h2>
      <div class="first">
            <p>TOKYO--- Although home to the oldest monarchy dating back to 660
            B.C., the city of Tokyo feels as if one stepped into a futuristic
            society. Home to more than 35 million people, the city is split up
            into 23 “special wards” that form Tokyo’s foundation. From Central
            Tokyo to East Tokyo, the 5,200 square mile radius makes it easy to
            transport anywhere by using the Tokyo Metro. Visiting the famous
            Meiji Shrine, shopping in the world’s busiest Tsukiji Outer Market,
            or exploring the extreme teenage fashion culture of Harajuku, Tokyo
            attracts every kind of tourist. Rich historic dynasties, meshed with
            a new wave technological society, creates the cities’ spectacular
            charm. Whether its politics, fashion, or overall culture, Tokyo has
            learned to adapt and create a one of a kind city; arguably one of
            the best in the world.
          </p>
          <h3>Friday 2 p.m. Harajuku</h3>
          <p>
            After landing and getting settled, visitors should head directly to
            the Harajuku district to enjoy the ultimate culture shock. Harajuku
            is home to Japan’s most extreme teenage culture and fashion trends.
            In between Shinjuku and Shibuya on the Yamanote line, the colorful
            neighborhood exudes Japan’s kawaii culture. Takeshita Dori
            (Takeshita Street) is the center of Harajuku’s teenage kawaii
            culture. The street is lined up with trendy shops that sell things
            like clothing and make up. The street offers food stands as well
            selling the most Instagram-worthy snacks like fried potato chips on
            a stick and rainbow cotton candy.
          </p>
          <h3>4 p.m. Omotesando</h3>
          <p>
            Located right next to Harajuku, Omotesando is known as the “high
            end” avenue. Omotesando caters to an older and wealthier crowd. With
            hundreds of cafes and restaurants, the avenue also offers a shopping
            mall with famous Japanese brands like “Edition”. There are more than
            100 shops within the mall, which is bound to make a person hungry
            from exploring. Mr. Farmer is a farm-to-table vegetable café with
            the absolute freshest ingredients. Opened in 1994 the restaurant
            includes vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, and power protein options
            for visitors. Omotesando is a great place to go if you’re looking to
            shop some local Japanese brands and eat healthy plant-based food
            inspired by Japanese farmers. Omotesando is only a five-minute walk
            to the Meiji-Jingumae station which brings us to our next
            destination.
          </p>
          <h3>6 p.m. Meiji Shrine</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most famous historical landmarks in Tokyo built in 1920,
            the Meiji Shrine is dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken.
            Emperor Meiji was the first emperor of modern Japan and reigned
            during the Meiji period. During his reign, Japan became the modern
            and westernized society we know of today. With both an east and
            south entrance the shrine expands from Harajuku station to Yoyogi
            station. The Meiji Shrine is a great attraction to visit in order to
            get a brief history lesson while taking a beautiful stroll through
            the 100,000 donated trees which make up the Meiji Jingu forest.
            Tourist can participate in shrine activities such as making
            offerings at the main temple.
          </p>
          <h3>8 p.m. Shibuya</h3>
          <p>
            After the long day of shopping and getting to know Tokyo’s past and
            present culture, a great way to end the night is to visit and grab a
            bite by the famous Shibuya crossing station. One of Tokyo’s busiest
            districts; the beauty of witnessing 2,500 people running in unison
            across an intersection in front of the stations Hachiko exit, is
            something everyone should see in their lifetime. Filled with neon
            lights and tons of department stores, Shibuya will catch the eye of
            any tourist. For dinner, go to Uobei Sushi. Uobei sushi is a chain
            restaurant that started the trend of ordering sushi through a touch
            screen machine that instantly delivers the dish as its purchased.
            Costing around 100 yen (about $1) per roll, Uobei sushi is a fun,
            cheap restaurant guaranteed to elevate your Tokyo experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Saturday 10 a.m. Mori Art Museum</h3>
          <p>
            Founded by developer Mori Minoru, the museum displays contemporary
            art with a twist of urban planning. The museum offers exhibits that
            show future development blueprints of new buildings and other types
            of architect. Located in Roppongi Hills, the museum offers
            contemporary art sections for local Japanese and Asian artist. Most
            of the exhibits are simulated and interactive, which makes the
            visitor feel a part of the art. The exhibits have a purpose to
            question culture and society through creation. On the 52nd floor,
            the museum offers an observation deck where visitors can spend a few
            minutes gazing at the beautiful city views.
          </p>
          <h3>1 p.m. Tokyo Tower</h3>
          <p>
            After the museum head over to Tokyo Midtown to visit the famous
            Tokyo Tower. The tower is self-supported and resembles the Eiffel
            Tower in Paris. Standing at 333 meters high, the tower represents
            Japan’s economic power. You can pay to go up the main deck of the
            tower at 150 meters or the top deck of the tower at 250 meters. Due
            to the tower’s location of being in the center of Tokyo, the view
            from the top deck looks over the whole entire city. One of the best
            observation decks in Tokyo with a view so amazing, you can sometimes
            see Mount Fuji.
          </p>
          <h3>3 p.m. Roppongi</h3>
          <p>
            Roppongi is an increasingly popular district in Tokyo known amongst
            foreigners and Japanese young adults. Roppongi has a major night
            life scene that offers lots of clubs and bars to the public. Many
            art museums and luxury hotels have popped up around the area causing
            the development of the city to expand. Both Tokyo Midtown and
            Roppongi Hills are located within the Roppongi district. After
            touring the museum and Tokyo Tower, take some time to walk around
            the district and explore what it has to offer. For a late lunch go
            for ramen at JR Tokyo ramen street. JR Tokyo ramen street is a strip
            of amazing ramen restaurants located in an underground metro
            station. Eating here will help you understand Roppongi’s grungy yet
            sophisticated culture.
          </p>
          <h3>6 p.m. Robot Restaurant</h3>
          <p>
            The Robot Restaurant is a unique experience that provides audiences
            with a live show while they dine. Upon your arrival after purchasing
            tickets, the staff will bring you to a waiting room before the show
            begins. In the waiting room staff are in costumes serving drinks and
            snacks. Once the show is ready to start the audience is led to their
            seats. The show tells the story of Japanese culture and stereotypes
            through the years. As you eat dinner, loud pop music roars through
            the room while people on stilts dressed in anime break out in dance.
            The show is 90 minutes and takes plenty of twist and turns along the
            way. Introducing characters like kung fu panda and robot dinosaurs.
            The Robot Restaurant is an odd experience to say the least but, if
            you’re in Tokyo, this bizarre attraction is a must.
          </p>
          <h3>9 p.m. Golden Gai</h3>
          <p>
            After having an interesting time at the Robot Restaurant, ending off
            the night in the Golden Gai district is the absolute move. Located
            in Shinjuku, Golden Gai is a street of more than 200 bars and clubs
            lurking between the alleyways. Golden Gai is usually where the
            locals go to party but if you know the right places, you’ll fit
            right in. A few of the bars openly welcome foreign guests with signs
            and menus set outside listing prices in English. Some of the best
            bars for tourist are Albatross and Bitter Orange. Both bars have a
            gothic feel to them and are open almost all night. Similar to
            speakeasy’s, the bars are very low key with minimal people inside.
            If you’re looking to extend your freaky night after the Robot
            Restaurant, these are the places to check out.
          </p>
          <h3>Sunday 10 a.m. TeamLab Borderless</h3>
          <p>
            TeamLab Borderless is an art museum with a total twist. The lab is a
            massive space of artwork all digitally projected amongst the walls.
            Artwork with no limits, the artist work together to form one
            beautiful moving canvas. There are multiple rooms with different
            themes and artworks throughout the venue. A three-dimensional 10,000
            square meter world of moving art. There are rooms filled with
            massive balloons and even digital animals swimming and crawling
            around. A trip to TeamLab Borderless, is a visit a tourist will
            never forget.
          </p>
          <h3>12:30 p.m. Tsukiji Outer Market</h3>
          <p>
            The Tsukiji Outer Market is placed across the street where the
            original Tsukiji wholesale market used to be. If you’re in Tokyo,
            this is a must. The market consists of blocked off streets with
            people selling fresh produce, seafood, meats, anything you can think
            of. If you’re coming to the market you must try the fish. Some of
            the best sushi in the world is sold and prepared right here in this
            market. Locals who don’t speak English are yelling out trying to
            sell you everything and anything, It’s an experience. After walking
            through the market and buying some goodies, lunch at Sushi Dai is
            the last stop on the list. Sushi Dai is a Michelin star restaurant
            located within the Tsukiji Market. People line up for hours just to
            enjoy the chef’s choice of selected fish, some people starting to
            wait at 5 a.m.! The preferred way to order is omakase style where
            the chef prepares his favorite fish selection of the day. From toro,
            to uni, to shrimp, a tourist will never have better or fresher
            tasting sushi in their life.

          <h2>Walking trails at Big Cypress National Preserve</h2>
        <div class="second">
          <p> OCHOPEE, Fla.—Big Cypress National Preserve offers an array of
            activities and beautiful scenery for visitors to indulge in. A vast
            landscape measuring at 729,000 acres, the preserve is home to the
            Big Cypress Swamp which encompasses the essentials of the Everglades
            ecosystem. With over five different habitats including hardwood,
            hammocks, pinelands, prairies and cypress swamps, the preserve hosts
            a wide a variety of wildlife.
          </p>
          <p>
            Established in 1974, Big Cypress is considered to be the first
            national preserve in the United States. With over one million people
            visiting the preserve each year, The National Park Service ensures
            the protection of this landscape. Multiple activities are offered to
            those who visit, such as camping, kayaking, canoeing, and biking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way for visitors to get the full experience at Big Cypress
            National Preserve, is through their walking trails.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Big Cypress National Preserve has a travel planner website that
            assist visitors with directions, maps, photos, and hiking tips for
            the best walking trail experience. The trails range from easy to
            moderate, depending on one’s ability to trek through uneven terrain
            for a long period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Osvaldo Gonzalez is a permitted commercial service operator at Big
            Cypress National Preserve. He conducts tours for visitors looking to
            go fishing, hiking, and hunting. Osvaldo has hiked these walking
            trails multiple times and is very vocal on which is his favorite.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve been doing tours within this preserve for many years. During
            this time of COVID-19 it’s been difficult to get groups together on
            a hiking journey. I suggest to those who don’t mind getting dirty,
            to embark on the Gator Hook Trail. The trail is relatively easy and
            under five miles. From my experience, this trail offers the most
            beautiful scenery, but make sure to dress accordingly. There are
            points of the hike where you must step in muddy water which could
            possibly ruin your attire.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Gator Hook Trail consist of muddy, overgrown grassy, swampy
            backcountry. Even when its dry season, this trail still seems to be
            covered in wet mud. Considered an easy hike, the muddy terrain can
            sometimes cause the walk to be a little more difficult. Its best to
            wear hiking boots and long pants just in case the mud decides to
            swallow your feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are twist and turns throughout the trail causing levels of the
            land to differentiate in size. Parts of the trail allow visitors to
            pass the beautiful swamp, where wild birds and alligators are
            waiting to be seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a first-time visitor, the everglades can seem to be
            overwhelming. It’s vast landscape and unusual calmness can easily
            intimidate those visitors coming from the city scene of Miami. Those
            who aren’t fond of the wilderness tend to disregard the beauty this
            preserve has to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            During these struggling times of COVID-19, all indoor activities are
            limited. Taking a day trip to the everglades and enjoying a peaceful
            walk on a trail is deemed to be a successful pursuit during this
            global pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Donna Tamis, a Miami Beach native, took a trip to Big Cypress
            National Preserve for the first time in her life. Although not the
            most adventurous visitor, she embarked on a peaceful hike along the
            Fire Prairie trail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fire Prairie Trail is about five and a half miles. If one
            decides to walk the full path, it should take them about two and a
            half hours. Unlike the Gator Hook Trail, the Fire Prairie Trail is
            dry and dusty.
          </p>
          <p>
            “As a first timer walking on the trail, I could honestly say I
            enjoyed it very much,” said Donna Tamis. “Due to COVID-19 I’ve been
            looking for alternative activities to do outside of the city. My
            friend suggested taking a trip to Big Cypress National Preserve, so
            I went by myself for the day. I walked the Fire Prairie trail and
            saw all kinds of beautiful trees along the path. The trail was so
            vast, I felt as if I was the only person on earth.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fire Prairie Trail first starts off in a forest that then leads
            to an open dirt trail. The scenes of beautiful palm trees and
            palmetto bushes fill the landscape. This trail also allows for
            bikers to share the path. Although not the most scenic when it comes
            to animal sightings, the Fire Prairie Trail is a great hike for
            beginners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of all the walking trails the Big Cypress National Preserve has
            to offer, the Florida Trail Loop Hike is deemed to be the favorite.
          </p>
          <p>
            The full loop hike is about 16 miles long, but the trail can be cut
            a little more than half at six and a half miles. The trail is for
            hikers only, therefore no bikes are allowed. The entire hike along
            the Florida Trail Loop follows a canal where plenty of alligators
            have been seen, as well as rattlesnakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thomas Forsyth, superintendent at Big Cypress National Preserve,
            expresses some of his concerns for hikers walking the Florida Trail
            Loop Hike alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            “First things first, all hikers should bring a bottle of sunscreen
            and a hat. For most of the hike you will be directly exposed to the
            sun so make sure you’re prepared. Although considered to be the
            trail where people see the most wildlife, the path is designed
            around the animal’s habitat. We recommend that no hikers get too
            close to the canal to prevent any altercations with an alligator.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There have been no fatal instances yet but, with the
            superintendent’s advice in mind, hikers remain a safe distance from
            the canal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from alligator sightings, the Florida Trail Loop Hike offers
            the sights of unique birds like the wood stork. For insect and plant
            lovers alike, the trail is infested with butterflies as well as
            mosquitos; make sure to bring insect repellent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Towards the end of the hike, the canal is left behind. An array of
            pine trees harbor what is left of the grass trail, this is where the
            possible sights of panthers are seen. Boots are recommended on this
            trial due to the tall grasslands that hide rattlesnakes. Overall,
            the Florida Trail Loop Hike is the most scenic, but also the most
            dangerous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each walking trail at Big Cypress National Preserve has something
            unique to offer visitors. During a time of global crisis, a nice
            walk-through nature can remind citizens of the natural beauty the
